// DS is just collection of values, Alg's just manipulate those values
// Different types of data belong in different structures because data is more useful when it is organized properly

/** How computers store */
// CPU, RAM, Storage
// CPU can access RAM much faster than non-volatile memory
// CPU connected to memory controller than performs R/W to RAM
// Called RAM because controller can access any address because it has a connection to each address
// Tend to get information near by, closer to the CPU, faster it is
// Tuned to get information that is close by
// CPU also has a cache for most recent operations
// RAM limitations prevent storing unlimited information

/**Goal */
// Minimize the amount of operations for getting or storing data

/**Operations */
// Access, Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching, Sorting
