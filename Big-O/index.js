/**Good Code */

// Readable, Scalable (Big O measures this), Predictable
// JS has performance.now() to measure how many ms things take
// Need to determine what happens when input grows; the slower it slows down, the better
// Calculate operations performed to abstract performance analysis from machine

/**O(n) */

// Increases linearly based on the input. n items = n operations

/**O(n) */

// Always takes a constant time, or KNOWN number of steps. 
// Even if multiple operations, still constant, so no matter the input runtime stays constant
