/**Linear search */

// Find target value in list by checking each value sequentially. 
// O(1) best and O(n) worst case

/**Binary search */

// Divide and conquer, so log n time
// List needs to be sorted, and can then be better than O(n), b/c discarding half the items every run
// Data stored in a tree is more efficient

/**Graph and tree traversal */

// If traversal visits every node then must be linear time
// Better than list because graph/tree avoids linear search
// Better than array because faster insertion/deletion
// Better than a hashtable because hashtables are not ordered
